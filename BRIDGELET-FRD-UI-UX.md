Bridgelet - Functional Requirements Document (FRD) for UI/UX Design.

1. Product Overview

What is Bridgelet? A crypto onboarding solution that lets anyone send cryptocurrency to recipients who don't have wallets yet. Think "Venmo request" but for crypto - send first, recipient claims later. Core Value Proposition: • Sender doesn't need recipient's wallet address upfront • Recipient gets crypto with one click (no app downloads, no seed phrases) • Works with any Stellar-based asset (XLM, USDC, etc.)

2. User Personas

Persona A: The Sender (Alice) • Profile: Crypto-literate, has existing wallet • Goal: Send crypto to someone without asking for their wallet address • Pain Point: "My friend doesn't have a wallet yet, and explaining how to set one up takes forever" • Tech Comfort: Medium to High

Persona B: The Recipient (Bob)

• Profile: May have never used crypto before • Goal: Receive money someone sent them • Pain Point: "Crypto is too complicated. I just want my money." • Tech Comfort: Low to Medium • Critical Assumption: Bob HAS a destination wallet (or gets one before claiming)

3. User Journeys

Journey 1: SENDER CREATES A CLAIM (Alice)

Entry Point: Alice visits bridgelet.io or uses an integrated app Steps:

UI Components & Patterns 5.1 Navigation Public Pages (No Auth): • Logo (links to homepage) • "How It Works" • "Send Funds" (CTA button) Authenticated Pages (Sender Dashboard): • Logo • "Dashboard" • "New Payment" • User menu (wallet address, disconnect)
5.2 Buttons Primary Action: • Style: Solid, high-contrast • Use: "Claim Now", "Confirm & Pay", "Send Funds" Secondary Action: • Style: Outlined or ghost • Use: "Back", "Cancel" Destructive Action: • Style: Red/warning color • Use: "Reclaim Funds", "Cancel Payment"

5.3 Form Inputs Standard Input: • Label above input • Placeholder text • Helper text below (if needed) • Validation feedback (inline, real-time) Amount Input: • Large font size • Currency symbol/code shown • Max 2 decimal places • Show USD equivalent below (if applicable) Address Input: • Monospace font • Auto-trim whitespace • Show validation status (✓ or ✗) • Copy button if pre-filled

5.4 Status Indicators Unclaimed: • Icon: ⏳ or 🕐 • Color: Yellow/Amber • Text: "Waiting to be claimed" Claimed: • Icon: ✅ • Color: Green • Text: "Claimed on [Date]" Expired: • Icon: ❌ or ⏰ • Color: Red • Text: "Expired on [Date]"

5.5 Copy-to-Clipboard Pattern: Any long text (addresses, links, tx hashes) • Show truncated version • "Copy" button adjacent • On click: Brief "Copied!" confirmation • Full text shown on hover (tooltip)

5.6 Loading States Page Load: • Full-page spinner with message • e.g., "Loading your claim..." Action in Progress: • Button shows spinner • Button text: "Processing..." • Button disabled during process Long Operation: • Progress indicator • Step-by-step status • Don't allow navigation away

5.7 Modals/Dialogs Confirmation Modals: • Clear title • Explanation of action • "Cancel" + "Confirm" buttons • Example: "Are you sure you want to cancel this payment?" Info Modals: • "How It Works" • "What is a Stellar address?" • Scrollable content • "Close" button

Content & Messaging 6.1 Tone & Voice • Friendly, not technical: Avoid jargon (use "wallet address" not "Ed25519 public key") • Reassuring: Crypto is scary for newcomers - emphasize safety • Clear & concise: Short sentences, no fluff 6.2 Key Messages For Senders: • "Send crypto even if they don't have a wallet yet" • "Share a link, that's it" • "Unclaimed funds automatically return to you" For Recipients: • "You've received crypto!" • "Claim it in one click" • "Safe and secure" 6.3 Error Messages DO: • Explain what happened • Suggest next steps • Provide support contact DON'T: • Show raw error codes • Blame the user • Use technical jargon Example: ❌ Bad: "Error 500: Internal server exception" ✅ Good: "Something went wrong on our end. Please try again or contact support."

Responsive Design Requirements 7.1 Mobile (Primary) Critical: Most recipients will be on mobile (SMS links) Requirements: • Single column layout • Large tap targets (min 44x44px) • Minimal scrolling on claim page • Keyboard-friendly inputs • Works on iOS Safari & Chrome Android 7.2 Desktop Nice-to-have: • Two-column layouts where appropriate • QR code prominent on success screen • Hover states for interactive elements 7.3 Breakpoints • Mobile: < 768px • Tablet: 768px - 1024px • Desktop: > 1024px

Accessibility Requirements • WCAG 2.1 AA compliance minimum • Keyboard navigation support • Screen reader friendly • Color contrast ratios: 4.5:1 for text • Focus indicators on all interactive elements • Alt text for all images • Form labels properly associated • Error messages announced to screen readers

Performance Requirements • Initial page load: < 2 seconds • Claim verification: < 1 second • Sweep execution: 5-10 seconds (blockchain dependent) • Smooth animations (60fps)

Edge Cases & Special Scenarios 10.1 Multiple Claims Same Recipient Scenario: Bob receives 3 claim links from different people Behavior: • Each claim is independent • Bob can reuse same wallet address • No account needed - each claim is stateless from Bob's perspective

10.2 Partial Claims Scenario: Can Bob claim only part of the amount? Answer: No - it's all or nothing • Reason: Smart contract sweeps entire ephemeral account

10.3 Reclaiming Funds Scenario: Alice sent funds but Bob never claimed. It expired. Behavior: • In sender dashboard, status shows "Expired" • "Reclaim Funds" button available • One-click reclaim back to Alice's original wallet • Confirm modal: "Reclaim 50 USDC back to your wallet?"

10.4 Network Congestion Scenario: Stellar network is slow/congested Behavior: • Show warning: "Network is experiencing delays" • Increase timeout before showing error • Provide tx hash immediately so user can track independently

10.5 Browser Refresh During Claim Scenario: Bob clicks "Claim" then accidentally refreshes page Behavior: • If sweep not yet executed: Safe to retry • If sweep in progress: Show "Checking transaction status..." • If sweep completed: Show success (retrieve from backend)

10.6 Expired Link After Opening Scenario: Bob opens link while valid, takes 2 days to claim, expires in between Behavior: • Backend checks expiry on claim attempt • Show error: "This claim expired while you had it open" • Suggestion: "Contact the sender for a new link"

Security & Privacy Considerations 11.1 Token Security • Claim tokens are JWT (signed, not encrypted) • Tokens are single-use (consumed on claim) • Tokens expire based on sender's choice • Tokens cannot be guessed (cryptographically random) 11.2 Wallet Address Validation • Client-side: Format validation (length, prefix) • Server-side: Additional checksum validation • No storing of wallet addresses (unless recipient opts in) 11.3 Rate Limiting • Claim attempts: 5 per token per 10 minutes • Account creation: 10 per IP per hour • Prevents abuse/spam

Analytics & Tracking Requirements Track these events for product insights: Sender Journey: • Form started • Form completed • Payment confirmed • Link copied • Link shared (via which method) Recipient Journey: • Claim link opened • Wallet address entered • Claim confirmed • Claim succeeded • Claim failed (with error type) Business Metrics: • Claim conversion rate (opened → claimed) • Time to claim (link created → claimed) • Expiry rate (claims that expired unclaimed) • Reclaim rate

Future Enhancements (Out of Scope for MVP) These are NOT required for initial design, but good to keep in mind: • Multi-asset claims: One link, multiple tokens • Scheduled claims: "Claimable after March 1st" • Conditional claims: "Must verify email first" • Recurring payments: "Send 50 USDC every month" • Recipient accounts: Bob can track all his received claims • Fiat off-ramp: "Claim to bank account instead of wallet"

Questions for Designer After reviewing this document, please confirm your understanding of:

Primary user flow: Sender creates → Recipient claims

Key screens needed: ~8-10 unique screens

Mobile-first approach: Most recipients on mobile

Error handling: Multiple failure scenarios to design for

Branding constraints: Do we have existing brand guidelines, or starting from scratch?

Design Deliverables Expected

User Flow Diagrams o Sender journey flowchart o Recipient journey flowchart o Error state flows

Wireframes (Low-Fi) o All screens listed in Section 4 o Mobile & desktop versions o Annotations for interactions

High-Fidelity Mockups o Visual design applied o All states (default, hover, active, disabled) o Error states o Loading states

Interactive Prototype o Clickable prototype (Figma, Adobe XD, etc.) o Demonstrates complete user flows o Includes animations/transitions

Design System / Style Guide o Colors (primary, secondary, success, error, etc.) o Typography (fonts, sizes, weights) o Spacing system o Component library (buttons, inputs, cards, etc.) o Icons

Timeline & Milestones Phase 1: Research & Wireframes (1-2 weeks) • User flow diagrams • Low-fidelity wireframes • Review & iterate Phase 2: Visual Design (2-3 weeks) • High-fidelity mockups • Design system creation • Review & iterate Phase 3: Prototype & Handoff (1 week) • Interactive prototype • Design specs for developers • Final review

Appendix: Technical Constraints (For Designer's Awareness) • Blockchain finality: Transactions take ~5-10 seconds (can't speed up) • No user accounts: Recipient side is stateless (no login/signup) • Single-use links: Once claimed, link is dead (can't re-claim) • Expiry is absolute: No grace period after expiry • Network dependency: If Stellar is down, nothing works (rare but possible)
